        <p>I hold a bachelor's degree in social science (interdisciplinary studies) from Michigan State University and recently completed an intensive software engineering program with Springboard, where I gained hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies. I currently have 78 projects on GitHub, that include JavaScript, Node.js, and React apps, and I have recently started learning C++. In my projects, I also utilize PostgreSQL and MongoDB for relational data storage. The two projects that I’m most proud of are my Visual Timer app and my News Aggregator app.</p>

                    <strong>Visual Timer App</strong><br>

            I developed this app to support students with special needs. Having worked with individuals with ADHD and those on the autism spectrum,
            I recognized the importance of visual aids in enhancing time management and understanding. The Visual Timer app provides a clear,
            visual representation of time, helping users manage tasks and transitions more effectively. This project not only allowed me to apply my technical
            skills in both the frontend and backend, but it also gave me the opportunity to create a tool with a positive impact on users' lives.

            As someone who loves staying updated with current events, I observed that many news websites lack commenting sections, which limits discussion
            on important topics. This inspired me to create the News Aggregator app, which compiles news stories from various sources and enables users
            to comment on articles that don’t offer native commenting features. This project highlights my ability to integrate multiple APIs and present data
            in a user-friendly way. I took full ownership of the development process, leveraging resources like instructional videos, documentation, Stack Overflow,
            and Reddit to resolve challenges. This project reflects my dedication to enhancing user engagement with news content while furthering my technical expertise.
