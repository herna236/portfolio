        <p>I hold a bachelor's degree in social science (interdisciplinary studies) from Michigan State University and recently completed an intensive software engineering program with Springboard, where I gained hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies. I currently have 78 projects on GitHub, that include JavaScript, Node.js, and React apps, and I have recently started learning C++. In my projects, I also utilize PostgreSQL and MongoDB for relational data storage. The two projects that Iâ€™m most proud of are my Visual Timer app and my News Aggregator app.</p>

                    This app helps travelers quickly convert exchange rates and explore destinations. It fetches real-time exchange rates using an API and dynamically
                    calculates currency conversions on the frontend using JavaScript. The app also features a contact page for inquiries. This project showcases my ability
                    to integrate third-party APIs, handle real-time data, and build user-friendly interfaces.
